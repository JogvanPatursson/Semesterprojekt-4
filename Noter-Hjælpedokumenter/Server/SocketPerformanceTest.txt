Goal:
To show which type of socket implementation will provide the best performance in terms of speed.

How:
Set up 1 server (1 server with threads, and 1 server with async sockets) and 1000 clients. Make the clients connect to the server at the same time and send 1 message.
Have the server receive the 1000 messages and output the amount of time it took from the first message to arrive, and to the last message to arrive.
Compare the results of the 2 implementations.
